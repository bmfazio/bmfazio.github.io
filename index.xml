      <description>Found this blog post from Jennifer Thompson today, thanks to the flurry of great content being shared on Twitter during #rstudioconf.
I’ve already been asked to help put together monitoring tools for human cohorts before and no doubt will be in the future. This will no doubt come in handy!</description>

      <title>Blind obsession</title>

      <description>Today I came across an excellent thread by Andrew Althouse on whether it makes sense to blind the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) in a RCT (it doesn’t). The main reason is provided in this tweet:
“More evidence is required to stop a trial because of a benefit than because of harm. Trials are performed to assess safety and efficacy, not to “prove” harm…it is unreasonable to make the monitors behave as if they were indifferent to the direction of a treatment difference.</description>

      <description>I have been meaning to set up a personal blog for probably over a year now and I’ve finally found the time to do so. I probably could have done this a few months ago if I hadn’t spent so much time agonizing over choosing between Jekyll and Hugo, as well as finding the ideal theme.
Although some of that time was certainly spent on unnecessary nitpicking, I think it was worth it as I ultimately feel I made a comfortably informed choice.</description>

      <description>About meHi! My name is Boris.
I studied biology in college but statistics caught my attention along the way. Most of the time I’m helping other researchers analyze their data or reading about things that will help me help others more efficiently.
In my free time I have started to create generative art. Hopefully I’ll have something nice to share here soon!
About this siteMy main motivation for setting up a blog is to document my progress and sporadically publish personal musings.</description>
