      <description>I have been meaning to set up a personal blog for probably over a year now and I’ve finally found the time to do so. I probably could have done this a few months ago if I hadn’t spent so much time agonizing over choosing between Jekyll and Hugo, as well as finding the ideal theme.
Although some of that time was certainly spent on unnecessary nitpicking, I think it was worth it as I ultimately feel I made a comfortably informed choice.</description>

      <description>About me Hi! My name is Boris.
I studied biology in college but statistics caught my attention along the way. Most of the time I’m helping other researchers analyze their data or reading about things that will help me help others more efficiently.
In my free time I have started to create generative art. Hopefully I’ll have something nice to share here soon!
 About this site My main motivation for setting up a blog is to document my progress and sporadically publish personal musings.</description>
