      <description>I have been meaning to set up a personal blog for probably over a year now and I’ve finally found the time to do so. I probably could have done this a few months ago if I hadn’t spent so much time agonizing over choosing between Jekyll and Hugo, as well as finding the ideal theme.
Although some of that time was certainly spent on unnecessary nitpicking, I think it was worth it as I ultimately feel I made a comfortably informed choice.</description>
